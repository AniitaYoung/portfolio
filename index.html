            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>After over a decade of working within the events & marketing industry I decided to take a leap of faith and persue a career change into computer programming and web development. 
                    Starting out with absolutely no programming experience I have been self-learning online since August 2023.
                    Although I have found a lot of it challenging, my curiosity to learn and the rewarding feeling I get from
                    learning a new skill, big or small, is worth it. I hope that as time goes by I will be able to feel more and 
                more confident in my own abilities. The projects I have worked on are growing too and it's nice to look back on many that I have worked on 
            remembering the obstacles I faced, and also knowing how much time/or lack there of, it took me to undestand the underlying 
        code to get there. </p>
